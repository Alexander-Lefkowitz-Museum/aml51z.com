Alex Lefkowitz passed away on 2018 July 22nd. He was best known around the internet for creating Flash games, his first and arguably most well known was Raging Flight, a sci-fi shooting game inspired by Combat Instinct.

He achieved some infamy with his later penchant for doing games in a shock-jock style vein, these include Sniper's Revenge and Tsunami Lootup, both respectively exploiting the media frenzy around the 2002 DC sniper attacks and 2004 Indian ocean tsunami.

Uniwar: Lost Civilization would be his last big game before disappearing from the limelight. It was something of a return to form: a sci-fi themed shooting game created together with long time friend Brian Fox (Doomhammr).

Several other lesser known games include retronoid, an arkanoid clone, and 3D pong. The last game that he's known to have made was called Brimstone.

Alex was a complex character who often presented himself as an overconfident contrarian online, but those who spent any meaningful time with him knew him as he was: just another guy who always tried to do the right thing.

This is an archive of all his known work that was able to be saved. Brimstone is currently missing from this archive, as well as an early version of Raging Flight 2 that was circulated around the flashstyle.net community. If you have copies of these, then please share them!

The Adobe Flash Player is required to play the games.

It saddens us to see you go so soon, Alex, but from all of us: we hope that you rest well.

Good Night.
