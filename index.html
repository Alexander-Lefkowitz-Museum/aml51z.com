                    Alex "aml51z" Lefkowitz passed away on July 22nd, 2018. He was best known around the internet for creating Flash games, his first and arguably most well known was Raging Flight, a sci-fi shooting game inspired by Combat Instinct.<br />
                    <br />
                    He achieved some infamy with his later penchant for doing games in a shock-jock style vein, these include Sniper's Revenge and Tsunami Lootup, both respectively exploiting the media frenzy around the 2002 DC sniper attacks and 2004 Indian ocean tsunami.<br />
                    <br />
                    Uniwar: Lost Civilization would be his last big game before disappearing from the limelight. It was something of a return to form: a sci-fi themed shooting game created together with long time friend Brian Fox (Doomhammr).<br />
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/images/_29811_10151466846134746_730864137_n.png" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 15px; border-radius: 15px;" alt="Alex Pretending to be Spiderman" title="Alex Pretending to be Spiderman" >
                    Several other lesser known games include retronoid, an arkanoid clone, and 3D pong. The last game that he's known to have made was called Brimstone.<br />
                    <br />
                    Alex was a complex character who often presented himself as an overconfident contrarian online, but those who spent any meaningful time with him knew him as he was: just another guy who always tried to do the right thing.<br />
                    <br />
                    This is an archive of all his known work that was able to be saved. Brimstone is currently missing from this archive, as well as an early version of Raging Flight 2 that was circulated around the flashstyle.net community. If you have copies of these, then please share them!<br />
                    <br />
                    The Adobe Flash Player is required to play the games.<br />
                    <br />
                    It saddens us to see you go so soon, Alex, but from all of us: we hope that you rest well.<br />
                    <br />
                    Good Night.<br />

                <p>Hello everybody, my name is Alexander Lefkowitz, this webpage is more or less a
                    blog/portfolio/insight type page I created for anything me related. I started it in 2005 and over
                    time have have settled on what you see here which I hope gives you an idea of who I am, my
                    personality, and my UI developer career.</p>
                <p>I’m a programmer, analyst, and developer. It’s my passion; it’s my means of art and expression. Web
                    programming is more than a tool; to me it’s how an idea turns into reality.</p>
                <p>Whether on my own or in collaboration my goal is to make something that exceeds expectations.</p>
                <br><img src="assets/images/badges.png" class="badge"/>
                <p>I'm a web game developer currently sinking my teeth into mobile game developement!</p>
                <p>And finally I'm a humor writer. Involved in various unrelated writing endeavours.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/images/brim2.jpg" class="Brim2"/>
                    <br>Please Check out my front end samples.<br><br>
                    Note: This site was coded back in 2012 so although not terrible is very simple and uses no advances
                    frameworks other then a little jQuery for some quick fade effects that work on all browsers.</p>

            <div id="skills">
                <p>After graduating High School I went to many technical institutes for computers, CTECH for Principals

                    attended Rockland Community College for networking and programming.</p>
                <p>I have also worked in IT departments for many different companies and have acquired 9+ years of
                    industry and hands on experience.</p>
                <p>I have learned and used a variety of different computer programming and scripting languages.</p>
                <p>As of now I know:<br/>
                    Object Oriented Javascript, jQuery, JSON, XML, CSS2, CSS3, SASS, LESS, XHTML, HTML, HTML5, HTML5
                    Video, Smarty, TWIG, Yahoo! Widgets/Konfabulator, SWFobject, Freewheel, Conviva, and a working
                    knowledge of Angular.js, D3, Dojo, PHP, C# and C++.</p>
                <p>I am currently learning and have some experience with React and various tools in the React tech
                    stack. I am also learning Vue.js</p>
            </div>
            <div id="recruiter">
                <p>Hello as you probably guessed I'm Alexander Lefkowitz</p>
                <p>I'm a US Citizen, legally able to work, my DOB is 5/12/1986, check the other sections here for skills
                    info regarding
                    what languages and tech stacks I know for you to use when presenting me in more detail but in a
                    nutshell I know:
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript (10 years)</li>
                    <li>Object Oriented aspects of JavaScript (6 years)</li>
                    <li>jQuery (8 years)</li>
                    <li>JSON (8 years)</li>
                    <li>XML (8 years)</li>
                    <li>CSS (14 years)</li>
                    <li>SASS (5 years)</li>
                    <li>LESS (5 years)</li>
                    <li>XHTML (8 years)</li>
                    <li>HTML (14 years)</li>
                    <li class="bump"><em>React (4 months work experience)</em></li>
                    <li><em>Angular (1 month practice)</em></li>
                </ul>
                </p>


                <p>Overall I've been a UI developer since 2006 if the framework has only been around for just a few
                    (such as React).</p>
                <p>I am interested in UI, UX, UI architecture, and general UI development and engineering. HTML/CSS
                    wireframes also works but might be under my pay grade.</p>
                <p>Since I live in the New York area I can readily work in New York City, Jersey City, NJ, Hoboken, and
                    the immediate area that I can get to via train and bus. Remote work is also definitely a plus.</p>
                <p>I am willing to work elsewhere and even another country but this must be funded by the agency or
                    company willing to hire me and must be provided prior to my travel, NO EXCEPTIONS!</p>
                <p>I have references but will not be giving their info out until I feel it's worth it.</p>

                <p>I value my time and talk to recruiters all the time. Please be mindful. My phone is generally on me
                    all day. If I gave all my info out to every recruiter that called me I'm sure I'd have my identity
                    stolen by now.
                    Over the years I've heard it all so to make it easier here is a list of things that will make me not
                    want to answer your calls, call you back, turn down the job almost immediately, or might make me
                    want to block you:
                <ul>
                    <li>Leaving a message without an extension or number.</li>
                    <li>Send me the job description to my email.<br/> And immediately call me asking me if I read all 9
                        paragraphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make me have to research to get back to you.</li>
                    <li>Calling me 2 times in a row while I'm currently on the phone,<br/> then 2 times again 5 minutes
                        later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Calling me 8 times back to back.</li>
                    <li>Calling me 8 times back to back, you deny it and when I email you back a <br/>copy of my call
                        log you blame apple for making a lying cellphone.
                    </li>
                    <li>You send me a screenshot of your desktop in a pinch and I see XXX file names on the desktop.
                    </li>
                    <li>Insist that Java and JavaScript are the same thing.</li>
                    <li>Tell me to just learn something and submit me without asking.</li>
                    <li>Be one of the 10 other recruiters that just are looking for a "JavaScript ninja"<br/>and keep
                        repeating that term.
                    </li>
                    <li>Say anything even remotely sexist, it tells me alot about your organization.</li>
                    <li>Calling me 3 times because you found an "URGENT" requirement even though I haven't responded to
                        the email.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I expect no less then $40 an hour and usually work for $50 to $70 an hour depending on work and
                    location</p>
                <p>DO NOT LIE OR MISREPRESENT ME TO CLIENTS, NO THIRD PARTIES, if I have reason to think you or your
                    company is sketchy for any reason I will probably ignore or block you. I will not lie to an employer
                    for you, I will not misrepresent myself to an employer, I will not exaggerate my skills. If you rely
                    on any of these things or find it necessary for the employee to do this then please move on.</p>
                <p>That said I would love to speak to you, double so if you are the actual employer. Feel free to give
                    me a ring or text me.</p>

                <p><strong>Hello internet:</strong> I'm just gonna leave this here...
                    <img src="assets/images/webapp.jpg"/><br/>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/NSmFQgg.gif"

                </p>
                <h3>Captains Log - 10:55pm - May 6th 2016</h3>
                <p><strong>I don't like AngularJS 1 and neither should you:</strong> Who would have known that once I
                    added what I would loosly call a "UI blog" to my site that an avalanche of things I want to point
                    out to the internet would be greater then my internet patience.
                </p>
                <p>My first experience oddly enough comes from a public facing website, a rather large one I won't
                    mention. While loading I saw {{ expressions in brackets }}. Now maybe I'm oldschool but wasn't the
                    whole point in half the standards I work in now exist so that the user can access content on most
                    devices and software? What if the user uses TOR and can't use JavaScript. I feel that AngularJS is a
                    front-end framework for Java programmers for prototyping purposes.</p>
                <br/>
                <img src="https://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/64638845.jpg"/>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Another problem I noticed, though I suppose less a problem and more the nature of UI work, is that
                    many times important financial information is being processed on the front end instead of the
                    backend. You should never use JavaScript in any way to handle such important information, only
                    output and experience.
                </p>
                <p>If I wanted to make a virus I would hook my code straight into the injections and directives. Who
                    knows what behind the scenes action is going on.</p>
                <h3>Captains Log - 5:34pm - May 5th 2016</h3>
                <p>What's it like being on the internet when your trade involves making websites? I would expect a car
                    machanic to see random things that would go over my head as he drives around traffic, noticing
                    different sounds, behaviors, and who knows what else when it comes to other cars and drivers.
                    Personally my experience with cars involves filling up at the pump and writing "clean me" on the
                    back of dirty SUV windows.</p>
                <p>First thing that comes to mind is HOLY CRAP I wrote this site your reading right now back in 2008.
                    The most recent code I added was the Did You Know? section on the bottom.</p>
                <p>The second thing I noticed is... wow I got LUCKY deciding to stay with JavaScript and HTML5, although
                    I started out with Flash... and I think Steve Jobs (rip) was too hard on Adobe, I'm glad the world
                    values people who likes to tinker with style sheets and turn browsers into application
                    containers.</p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z5o9aQ9.jpg"/><br/>
                <p>
                    But is that what the world wants? Oh JavaScript, you did right with the ECMA standard, but who the
                    hell put Java as the first part of your name?
                </p>

                <h2>2016 in a tailspin</h2>
                <h3><strong>10/10/2016 </strong>Is this a dream?</h3>
                <p><img style="float:right"
                        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Donald_Trump_swearing_in_ceremony.jpg/240px-Donald_Trump_swearing_in_ceremony.jpg"/>On
                    November 8th, 2016, the United States voted in Donald Trump as their 45th president, defeating
                    Hillary Clinton.</p>
                <p>In the aftermath, progressives are being told that this outcome is their fault. The finger is now on
                    progressives for calling conservatives racists, bigots, sexist, etc. And that the only path forward
                    is to now find common ground with conservatives.</p>
                <p>As a centerist I cannot possibly object more vehemently to this. I may share some aspects with
                    progressives but it's more complicated then that and this brings me to their hypocrisy and my next
                    point:</p>
                <h3>Social Justice Warriors and Snowflakes</h3>
                <p>There is a serious problem right now on college campuses and from what I see a lot of the YouTube
                    audience. People who have no strong political identity and like hearing quick easy catch-all
                    answers. I loved hearing Ben Shapiro tell a student that "facts don't care about your feelings".</p>
                <p><img style="float:right" src="assets/milo.jpg"/>There is a growing regressive left that seeks to
                    restrain and limit all speech and discourse they disapprove of. This often results in shouting down
                    dialogue, discussion, and even comedy is now off-limits. This has the unintended side effect of
                    legitamizing professional trolls like Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>
                <p>Being 31 (as of writing this), I grew up during the moral panic around violent video games. You know,
                    games like Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat. I grew up with the over-zealous FCC looking to scrub
                    the airwaves of any kind of profanity or nudity.</p>
                <p>
                    I objected to this, and fought against this. I grew a deep appreciation of the first amendment right
                    to freedom of speech.</p>
                <p>
                    The social justice movement is moving us from classic liberalism to just another form of
                    authoritarianism: seeking to control what people can and can't say.</p>
                <p>It is truly dangerous and I am very much opposed to this.</p>
                <h3>Bubble Trouble</h3>
                <p>There is unquestionably a genuine threat in bubbles. The left foolishly thought they had this race
                    taken care of. This is because they formed circles on social media and only followed the people that
                    agreed with. Any nonconformists were instantly blocked. So obviously, to them, it appeared like an
                    order that Clinton would win the race.
                <p>
                <p>Bubbles are indeed very dangerous. We need to have real discussions with people we disagree with, if
                    we ever hope to find common ground and unite as a people.</p>
                <p>There are legitimate grievances on both sides. I am more than willing to engage in a discussion
                    around inheritance tax, healthcare reform, social welfare, drug laws, the size of the military, the
                    size of government, and even heavy-hitting issues like abortion. I understand that someone can
                    disagree with me on these topics and not be wrong, and still have valid grievances.</p>
                <h3>Trump (oy vey :/)</h3>
                <p>But then there's Donald Trump. A candidate that ran his campaign on racism, misogyny, bigotry,
                    xenophobia, lies and hatred. A candidate who sought to divide our nation in order to assure his
                    victory.</p>
                <p>We now have a president-elect who openly mocked the handicapped, who called Mexicans criminals and
                    rapists, who called for jailing his political opponent, who encouraged another nation to hack and
                    undermine our fair election process, who fat-shamed a female beauty contestant, who bragged about
                    walking in on women in locker rooms, who boasted about how he could "grab women by the pussy" just
                    because he was famous, who has stated that he would nominate Supreme Court justices to reverse
                    marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples, who has promised to rescind all protections for
                    transgender individuals — such as the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender, a man who
                    has defrauded his own charity, who wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the country, and to
                    create a registry for them. A candidate who has declared the greatest threat to the survival of our
                    species — global warming — to be a Chinese hoax. Someone who chose Mike Pence as his running mate —
                    a man who believes in using electro-shock therapy to "turn gay kids straight", and who passed a Jim
                    Crow-era law to allow businesses to discriminate and deny service to gays and lesbians. A religious
                    nut one step away from being a flat earther. A man who refused to accept the results of the election
                    — if he lost, that is ... and claimed the election was rigged against him. A man who wants to allow
                    the further proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>This candidate is unlike any other candidate that has run in my entire lifetime. He is irredeemably
                    deplorable. Which is perhaps why Ku Klux Klan has endorsed him and held celebrations upon his
                    victory.</p>
                <h3>Clinton</h3>
                <p>Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate. She colluded with the DNC to steal the primary from Bernie
                    Sanders, which certainly cost us the election. She is a typical career politician, traveling around
                    the country and giving $200,000 speeches to Wall Street executives. Talking about how she has two
                    faces, one for the general public, another for the business elite.</p>
                <p>She is not a progressive. She would easily be considered a conservative in the '80s before the
                    Republican party went batshit insane. Today, compared to the rest of the world, she is a center
                    right candidate. She has been late on every socially progressive issue. Only coming around on
                    marriage equality in 2013, after more than half the country approved of them, and the vast majority
                    of her own party.</p>
                <p>I do not like Clinton. I did not want another family dynasty in the White House.
                    But she did at least spend her life working to help the poor and minorities to better their lives.
                    Their charitable foundation has done a lot of good in the world.</p>
                <p>Yet with all of her flaws — private e-mail server included — she was still the lesser of two evils by
                    an enormous margin in this election.</p>

                    <li>Living like you don't have much time to live is like saying live every day like you were bitten

            <li>We can create an atmosphere on Mars by simply dimming the lights and playing some smooth jazz.</li>
            <li>I think that instead of blocking people who use adblock, site's should just show all content in Comic
                Sans in all it's glory.
            </li>
            <li>If I'm at work early, either I was asked to come in early, I have a deadline, or my dog woke me up
                earlier then usual.
            </li>
            <li>I think everybody deserves a theme song, I just don't think anybody should choose their own.</li>

            <li>One day I hope to program an NES game/ROM</li>
            <li>I didn't think the Seinfeld final episode was that bad.</li>
            <li>Sometimes going to work feels like taking a break from life.</li>
            <li>Nobody can beat me in Mortal Kombat 3. Trust me many have tried.</li>
            <li>I come from a family of number people, I trained my younger brother to code, my older brother codes, my
                dad is an accountant and investment manager, and my mom owns her own store.
            </li>
            <li>I find it odd that our eyes are actually in the MIDDLE of our faces and not near the top.</li>
            <li>Watch out! I'm about to use an unsupported blink tag!</li>
            <li>Nah, just kidding. I'm not evil.</li>

            <li>Why was the JavaScript developer sad?... Because he didn’t Node how to Express himself. (Drum Drum
                Cymble!)
            </li>
            <li>How much wind will a wind mill mill if a windmill will mill wind?</li>
            <li>I think if bigfoot existed the ultimate time tested weapon to keep it away from you would be a camera.
            </li>
            <li>I wasn't good at Dojo so I had to pick myself up by my Bootstraps and.... Learn more Dojo? Ok I'm out of

<!-- script tags should almost always go on the bottom of a page, there
     are many reasons for this, it allows the page contents to load and
