        <h3>Captains Log - 10:55pm - May 6th 2016</h3>
        <p><strong>I don't like AngularJS and neither should you:</strong> Who would have known that once I added what I would loosly call a "UI blog" to my site that an avalanche of things I want to point out to the internet would be greater then my internet patience.
        </p>
        <p>My first experience oddly enough comes from a public facing website, a rather large on I won't mention. While loading I saw {{ expressions in brackets }}. Now maybe I'm oldschool but wasn't the whole point in half the standards I work in now exist so that the user can access content on most devices and software? What if the user uses TOR and can't use JavaScript. I feel that AngularJS is a front-end framework for Java programmers for prototyping purposes.</p>
        <br />
        <img src="https://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/64638845.jpg" />
        <br />
        <p>
        Another problem I noticed, thought I suppose less a problem and more the nature of UI work, is that many times important financial information is being processed on the front end instead of the backend. I'm going to make this clear...FRONT END IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS, THE FRONT END OF THE PRODUCT. You should NEVER use JavaScript in any way to handle such important information, only output and experience.
        </p>
        <p>If I wanted to make a virus I would hook my code straight into the injections and directives. Who knows what behind the scenes action is going on.</p>
        <h3>Captains Log - 5:34pm - May 5th 2016</h3>
      <p>What's it like being on the internet when your trade involves making websites? I would expect a car machanic to see random things that would go over my head as he drives around traffic, noticing different sounds, behaviors, and who knows what else when it comes to other cars and drivers. Personally my experience with cars involves filling up at the pump and writing "clean me" on the back of dirty SUV windows.</p>
      <p>First thing that comes to mind is HOLY CRAP I wrote this site your reading right now back in 2008. The most recent code I added was the Did You Know? section on the bottom.</p>
      <p>The second thing I noticed is... wow I got LUCKY deciding to stay with JavaScript and HTML5, although I started out with Flash... and I think Steve Jobs (rip) was too hard on Adobe, I'm glad the world values people who likes to tinker with style sheets and turn browsers into application containers.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z5o9aQ9.jpg" /><br />
      <p>
          But is that what the world wants? Oh JavaScript, you did right with the ECMA standard, but who the hell put Java as the first part of your name?
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MilKmny.png" /><br /><br />Sigh....<br />

      <p>I have worked for CNBC, All Things Media, Yeshiva Univercity, National Parts Depot, Droga5, and various agencies.</p>
      <p>My particular niche is single page web applications, the majority of the UI work I have done involves my competency in HTML(5), CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, LESS, JSON, XML, Photoshop, and various other smaller text, font, and debugger tools.
